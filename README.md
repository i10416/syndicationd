## Overview

![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/main/etc/dot/dist/overview.svg)

The subscribed feeds are stored in synd-api. synd-api periodically fetches the feeds to retrieve the latest entries.  
When the user views the feed list in synd, it retrieves the latest entries from synd-api's cache.  
This allows the user to quickly obtain a list of the latest entries without requesting each subscribed feed individually.

## Configuration

Settings can be configured in the following ways(in order of priority)

* Command line flag
* Environment variables
* Configuration file
* Default value

The location of the configuration file can be specified using `--config` or the environment variable `SYND_CONFIG_FILE`.  
By default, `synd` will search the following locations depending on the platform

| Platform | Locations |
| ---      | ---       |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/syndicationd/config.toml`<br>`$HOME/.config/syndicationd/config.toml` |
| macOS    | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/syndicationd/config.toml` |
|Windows   | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}/syndicationd/config.toml` |

`synd` does not automatically create configuration files.  
When creating a configuration file, you can use the following command

```sh
synd config init > config.toml
```

### Authentication

![Authentication overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/main/etc/dot/dist/authentication.svg)

Syndicationd maintains state (such as subscribed feeds) on the backend, and therefore requires authentication to make requests.  
Currently, GitHub and Google are supported as authorize server/id provider.   
The only scope required by syndicationd to authenticate users is the email address. please refer to the table below for details on the scopes for each provider.    

| IdP/AuthServer | Scope                                                                                                            |
| ---            | ---                                                                                                              |
| GitHub         | [`user:email`](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps)             |
| Google         | [`email`](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/devices#obtain_a_user_code_and_verification_url) | 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The user's email address is used only as an identifier after being hashed and never stored**.   

for more info, please refer to the [privacy policy](https://docs.syndicationd.ymgyt.io/synd-term/book/privacy_policy.html)

for more details, refer to [`keymap/default.rs`](https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/blob/main/crates/synd_term/src/keymap/default.rs)

### Subscribe feed

To subscribe a feed, type "Tab" to move to Feeds tab and then press "a".  
`synd` uses [edit](https://docs.rs/edit/latest/edit/) to launch the user's editor(like a git commit).  
The feed to subscribe to should be entered in the format:  
`Requirement` `Category` `URL`  

When you close the editor, the subscription request is sent to the API.

#### Requirement

`Requirement` indicates the importance of the feed.  
This uses an analogy to [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and can take one of the following values:

* `MUST`: Most important, must be read.
* `SHOULD`: Next in importance, should be read unless there is a special reason not to.
* `MAY`: Lowest importance, may be read.

#### Category

`Category` represents the category of the feed. You can specify any value as a category. The values that `synd` recognizes as categories are defined in [`categories.toml`](./categories.toml). Default values and additional categories can be added from the configuration file.


### Edit subscribed feed

To change the requirement or category of a feed you have already subscribed to, select the target feed in the Feeds tab and then press "e".

### Unsubscribe feed

To unsubscribe from a feed, select the target feed and press "d".

### Filter feeds/entries

Feeds and entries can be filtered as follows.

#### By requirement

To filter bases on the specified requirement, press "h/l(Left/Right)".  
If you set the filter to `MUST`, only those marked as MUST will be displayed. Setting it to SHOULD will display feeds and entries marked as MUST and SHOULD. If set to MAY, all feeds and entries will be displayed.

#### By categories

To filter bases on categories, presess "c". This will display a label with keys to control the activation/deactivation of each category, allowing you to toggle the visibility of categories.  
Pressing "-" will deactivate all categories, and pressing "+" will activate all categories.  

You can exit the filter category mode by pressing the "Esc" key.  
The icons for categories can be specified in `categories.toml`

### Open feed entry

To open a feed entry in a web browser, select the entry and press Enter.   
To view the entry in a text browser within the terminal, press the Space.   
The command that is triggered by pressing the Space can be specified using the `$SYND_BROWSER` environment variable, or through related flags or configuration files.   
The command is executed as `$SYND_BROWSER $SYND_BROWSER_ARGS <entry url>`.

### Export subscribed feeds

To export subscribed feeds, execute the `synd export` command.  
You can check the JSON schema of the data to be exported with `synd export --print-schema`

<details>
<summary>Click to show a export json schema</summary>

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Export",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "feeds"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "feeds": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "$ref": "#/definitions/ExportedFeed"
      }
    }
  },
  "definitions": {
    "ExportedFeed": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": [
        "url"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": [
            "string",
            "null"
          ]
        },
        "url": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### Import feeds

You can subscribe to multiple feeds at once using the `synd import` command.  
The input schema is the same as that of `synd export`. You can also check it with `synd import --print-schema`.  

```sh
# from stdin
echo '{"feeds": [ {"url": "https://this-week-in-rust.org/atom.xml", "category": "rust", "requirement": "Must" } ]}' 
| synd import -

# read from file
synd export > feeds.json
synd import feeds.json
```

### GitHub Notifications

<img alt="github notification screent shot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/main/etc/demo/ss/github_notification_ss.png" width="425"/> 

To enable GitHub notifications feature, specify the `--enable-github-notification | -G` flag or set the environment variable `SYND_ENABLE_GH=true`.  
When enabling the GitHub notifications feature, GitHub personal access token (PAT) is required. Specify the PAT using the `--github-pat` flag or the environment variable `SYND_GH_PAT`.  

> [!TIP]
> For GitHub notifications, unlike feeds, the synd-api is not used.

#### PAT Scope

##### Classic token

The `repo` scope is required. For more details, see [about github notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/notifications?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-github-notifications).

##### Fine grained access token

"Metadata" repository permissions (read) and "Notifications" user permissions (read) are required.  
For more details, see [list notifications for the authenticated user](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/notifications?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user).  
Since the Mark notification as done API does not support fine grained access token, classic token is required to use this feature.  


### Log 

The default log file path is based on [`ProjectDirs::data_dir()`](https://docs.rs/directories/latest/directories/struct.ProjectDirs.html#method.data_dir).  
Please refer to the `synd check` command for the output destination.  

You can modify the [log directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives) using the environment variable `SYND_LOG`. (for example, `SYND_LOG=synd=debug`)

### Theme

The theme can be changed using the `--theme` flag. Please refer to the help for the values that can be specified.

### Backend api

By default, `synd` use `https://api.syndicationd.ymgyt.io` as the [backend api](./crates/synd_api)([hosted on my home Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ymgyt/mynix/blob/main/homeserver/modules/syndicationd/default.nix)).  
To change the endpoint, specify the `--endpoint` flag

The hosted api is instrumented with OpenTelemetry. Basic signals(traces,metrics,logs) are published on the [![Grafana][grafana-badge]][grafana-url]

</details>

### Remove cache and logs

Authentication credentials are cached. to remove them, execute `synd clean`.

### Check application status

`synd check [--format (human|json)]` return current application status.

```sh
synd check

 Api Health: pass
Api Version: 0.2.4
     Config: /home/ferris/.config/syndicationd/config.toml
      Cache: /home/ferris/.cache/syndicationd
        Log: /home/ferris/.local/share/syndicationd/synd.log
```

```sh
# open log file
synd check --format json | from json | get log | bat $in
```

## License

This project is available under the terms of either the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE-APACHE) or the [MIT license](./LICENSE-MIT).

## Feed tips

Some tips about feed that I know.

* Add [`openrss.org/`](https://openrss.org/) to the beginning of the URL to get its RSS feed. for example, for `https://example.ymgyt.io`, it would be `https://openrss.org/example.ymgyt.io`

* You can retrieve various updates as feeds on GitHub.
  * To obtain releases of a repository, specify `releases.atom`. for example, to obtain releases of syndicationd, specify `https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/releases.atom`
  * For tags, it's `https://github.com/ymgyt/syndicationd/tag.atom` 

* crates.io have introduced a couple of experimental [RSS feeds](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/29/crates-io-development-update.html#rss-feeds)

* Adding `.rss` to the end of a Reddit URL allows you to retrieve the feed. for example, for `https://www.reddit.com/r/HelixEditor/`, it would be `https://www.reddit.com/r/HelixEditor.rss`
