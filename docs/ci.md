# CI

## GitHub Actions

### Workflows

#### [`audit`](.github/workflows/audit.yaml)  

It is scheduled to run periodically, updating the advisory database for `cargo audit` to the latest version before executing `cargo audit`

#### [`ci`](.github/workflows/ci.yaml)

Continuous integration is executed, and test coverage is uploaded to Codecov.  
When Dependabot updates dependencies and it is a patch version, it automatically merges the changes.

#### [`release`](.github/workflows/release.yml)

The workflow generated by `cargo dist` crates binaries and a GitHub release when a tag is pushed.  
Whether a package is included in this workflow is controlled by the `[package.metadata.dist.dist]` section in the Cargo.toml file.

#### [`release_image`](.github/workflows/release_image.yml)

Build the package's docker image and push it to the registry

#### [`website`](.github/workflows/website.yaml)

The workflow generated by `oranda generate ci` uploads the project's website to GitHub Pages.

#### `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`

* [cargo-dist doc](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/homebrew.html)
* `repo` scope is required

#### `NPM_TOKEN`

* [cargo-dist doc](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/npm.html)
* Packages and scopes: Read and write
  * Select packages: All packages (NOTE: because the package does not yet exist, you must pick this. However, you can (and probably should!) update this to scope the token to a single package after publish. This is sadly a limitation of the npm token system.)
  * Organizations: No access
